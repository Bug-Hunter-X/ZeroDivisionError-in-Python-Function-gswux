# ZeroDivisionError in Python Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in Python: the `ZeroDivisionError`. The error occurs when trying to divide a number by zero, resulting in an exception.

## Bug Description

The `function` in `bug.py` attempts to divide `a` by `b`, but if `b` is zero, a `ZeroDivisionError` is raised. This example shows how to prevent this type of error in your code. The solution is in `bugSolution.py`.
